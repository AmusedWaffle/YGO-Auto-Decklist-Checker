# YGO-Auto-Decklist-Checker
An automatic deck list checker I'm working on in my spare time

For now, this takes as input a simple text file with specific formating.
Example formating:
"3 Pot of Greed
3x Graceful Charity
2 Blue-Eyes White Dragon

1x Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon

3x Lightning Storm
3x Dark Ruler No More"

It expects:
1. Single newline character in between the main, side, and extra
2. Full name of each card to be typed out
3. Number before each card name

It doesn't care about:
1. Case
2. "x" being after the number
